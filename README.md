### 🌱 About Me

I'm a learner in the <strong>ALX Front and Back End Web Development Programs</strong>, currently growing into a full-stack developer with a foundation rooted in business, strategy, and real-world problem solving.

Before diving into tech, I worked in SME Banking at <strong>UBA Plc</strong>, where I helped real businesses grow through value-based financial solutions. I’m now combining that hands-on business experience with tech skills to build tools that matter.

My goal? To create digital solutions that are not only functional, but <em>thoughtful, human-centered, and impactful</em>.

- Building small but real-world-inspired projects as I go  
- Exploring how to bridge business logic with clean, maintainable code  
- Growing a portfolio that reflects my purpose and personal style  
- Preparing for my first dev role by strengthening core fundamentals

### 🧠 What Drives Me

- I believe growth doesn't have to be loud—just consistent.
- I enjoy solving problems through **clarity, not chaos**.
- I aim to build projects that feel human, not just technical.
- I value learning in context—where code meets real life.
